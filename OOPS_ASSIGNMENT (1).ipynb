        "Encapsulation: Is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, a class. It's about restricting direct access to some of an object's components and preventing accidental modification.\n",

        "Public: Attributes and methods are public by default (no leading underscores). They can be accessed from anywhere.\n",
        "Protected: Attributes and methods are prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., _my_attribute). This is a convention indicating that they should be treated as protected and are primarily for internal use within the class and its subclasses. However, they can still be accessed from outside the class.\n",
        "Private: Attributes and methods are prefixed with a double underscore (e.g., __my_attribute). This triggers name mangling, making them harder to access from outside the class directly. While not truly private (you can still access them using the mangled name), it's a stronger convention for indicating privacy.\n",
